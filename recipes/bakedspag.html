<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Comforting baked spaghetti recipe with plenty of melted cheese — the perfect dish for potlucks, family gatherings, or a weeknight dinner.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 (16 ounce) package spaghetti</li>
    <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
    <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
    <li>1 (32 ounce) jar meatless spaghetti sauce</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon seasoned salt</li>
    <li>2 large eggs</li>
    <li>⅓ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    <li>5 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
    <li>2 cups small curd cottage cheese</li>
    <li>5 cups shredded mozzarella cheese, divided</li>
</ul>
<h3>Directions</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
    <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender but firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, heat a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir beef and onion in the hot skillet until meat is browned and onion is soft and translucent, about 5 to 7 minutes. Drain excess oil from the pan; stir in spaghetti sauce and seasoned salt.</li>
    <li>Whisk eggs, Parmesan, and butter in a large bowl. Add spaghetti and toss to coat.</li>
    <li>Place 1/2 of the spaghetti mixture in the prepared baking dish. Top with 1/2 of the cottage cheese, 2 cups mozzarella, and 1/2 of the meat sauce. Repeat layers. Cover with aluminum foil.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 40 minutes. Remove the foil and sprinkle with remaining 1 cup mozzarella. Continue to bake until cheese is melted and lightly browned, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
